	<p>This is the place where reports are build, and run. There are
		two ways to build a report using a WYSIWYG editor or source editor for
		.jxml file, the last one is for advanced users. In preview we can see
		our report filled with data from datasource and save the results in
		different formats.</p>
	<h2>Design mode WYSIWYG editor.</h2>
	<p>Most used editor, in Jaspersoft Studio. This editor is used
		together with Outline View, Properties View, Palette and Problems
		View. Some complex JasperReports components like List, Table, Crosstab
		have their own editor, to open it just double click on the element in
		the designer or outline view. There are some buttons on the toolbar to
		control zoom, publish reports to a Jaspersoft Server, open query
		editor or change settings related to rulers, grid, decorators. To add
		elements to the page drag and drop them from the palette or it's
		possible to drag and drop Fields, Properties or Variables from outline
		view directly to the report. Use context menu to delete, arrange,
		resize, align, set PDF properties of the elements. It's possible to
		use keyboard to manipulate elements on the canvas: DEL to delete an
		element, arrows to select elements, &ldquo;.&rdquo; (point) will
		select an operation like riseze left, right, up, down, or move.</p>

	<h2>Source mode.</h2>
	<p>This is a simple text editor with xml syntax highlighting. We
		can use it in combination with Outline view where all xml nodes are
		visible and clicking on a node will show position to the corresponding
		line in text editor.</p>
	<p>Jrxml errors are shown in the left vertical band of the editor
		in front of the problematic line, users can see all the errors in
		Problems view, clicking on an error will position the cursor to the
		error line in the editor.</p>

	<h2>Preview mode.</h2>
	<p>The goal of this view is to for prompt user input parameters,
		help configure some settings, select a DataAdapter, see generated
		report in different formats, save report to a file. There are three
		main parts to do that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>toolbar with buttons to select DataAdapter, run report button
				and a menu to select the preview mode like java, html, csv, etc.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>on the right we have a preview for each format, for html this
				will be an embedded browser, for Java we'll have some additional
				controls like page navigation, zoom.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>The right part, contains several pages: input controls,
				biult-in controls, sort fields, exporter preferences</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
