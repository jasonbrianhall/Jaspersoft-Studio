         At the end of this steps we have a report with a complex layout and a main dataset used to provide many records. Then another dataset is used to fill a chart. Then all this can be compiled and exported. Doing this we have seen many complex concepts like the subdataset and the charts.

            Every report has a main dataset, defined when the report is created. But sometime we need more than one dataset, because we need data from different datasources or becasue we need to discover the same datasource with different query. In this cheetsheet we will see how to create a dataset other than the main one.
