	<section>

		<para>
			In this view you can see and manage DataAdapters, Jasperreports Server connections and resources.
			Toolbar of the view contains two actions, one to create a DataAdapter another to create a
			Jasprereports Server connection. Management of tree objects is done with context menu.
		</para>
		<para>
			Inside
			<emphasis>DataAdapters</emphasis>
			tree item we can see all the DataAdapters stored in eclipse preferences at instance level. In context menus we have actions to create, edit, delete, duplicate data adapters. DataAdapters can be
			stored in filesystem inside eclipse projects, there are actions to import and export data adapters to or from eclipse preferences.
		</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				It's better to store DataAdapters inside the projects, because finally reports will be deployed somewhere.

		<para>
			From context menu inside
			<emphasis>Servers</emphasis>
			it's possible to create, edit, doublicate or delete a server connection. To see objects inside a server connection, click on the arrow on the left of connection name, after some seconds (depending
			on your connection and server communication speed) the node will be populated with a list of Jasperreports Server objects like folders, ReportUnits, connections, reports, etc.
		</para>
		<para>
			Right click on an object, depending on resource type we can see actions that are possible on this type of resource. Common actions are cut, copy, paste, refresh. To open a dialog where we can see
			or edit the object, use
			<guimenu>Properties</guimenu>
			menu item.
		</para>
		<para>In case of ReportUnits there is an action to run this reports on a server and view them in Jaspersoft Studio.</para>
		<tip>
			<para>
				Cut, Copy and Paste actions work inside the same server connection. Currently it's not possible to copy resources between different servers.
