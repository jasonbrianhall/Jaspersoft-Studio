Opal has a bug where it look always is the current class to retrieve the class
loader and load the images. This cause problems in the overrides because the getClass
return a JSS Class, with it's own classloader, that normally can't find the opal resources
since they are inside the opal jar. However to fix this for now we have imported the opal resources
inside the studio plugin (the opal widgets are use only here), with the same name\paths, so also 
the classloader of the JSS class can find this resources. But it is an opal bug that assumes there
are no subclasses of the widgets, when they will fix it this folder can be removed.
