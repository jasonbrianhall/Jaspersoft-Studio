	<title>The Composite Elements</title>
	<section>
		<formalpara><title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			The composite elements are a new kind of user created element introduced in Jaspersof Studio with the version 6.1.1. They allow to create a new element in the palette starting from one or more basic elements, and reuse them whenever you want in any report. For example it is possible to create a composite element using a static text and a text field with some attributes already predefined (like the fonts or the colors). You will have this new element in the palette and when you drag it in the report it will create the same Static Text and Text Field with the same set of properties of the originals.
		</para>
		<para>
			This composite elements are stored inside a special folder of your workspace, so when you switch your version of Jaspersoft Studio you will found always your previously created elements as soon as you use the same Workspace.

		<para>
			NOTE: if you create the element inside a palette that in the next run is missing. This can happen maybe because you have created it with a Jaspersoft Studio Pro, placing them inside the Pro Compontents section of the palette, but you are reusing them into a Community version. The Community version has not the Pro Compontents section, in this case and in every case where the palette of a Composite Element is missing, it will be displayed in the Composite Elements section of the palette.

When this option is selected a special editor will be opened where where you can see all the contents of the element and you can modify it as you wish. This editor will look really similar to the report editor but with some simplifications: there will be only a band where the content is placed, there will be no dataset a no possibility to create one and the palette will allow to use only a set of basic elements. In this editor you can add new elements, remove the existing ones or change their properties.
